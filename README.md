# Welcome to my Advent of Code repo! 🎄

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to 25th. Each day, a new problem is released. This repository contains my solutions, written in Python, along with scripts to automate fetching inputs and submitting answers.

# Prerequisites 🐍

- Python 3.12.0+
- `pip` for managing dependencies

## Installing Dependencies:

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside repo dir

# How to Use 👀

1. Set year, day, and part in config.json
2. Complete solution in the `year/day` directory's solution.py
3. Run main.py

# Advent of Code Automation 🚀

This repo follows the automation guidelines on the r/adventofcode community [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation)

- Outbound calls are throttled to every 10 minutes in `aoc_gateway.fetch_input`
- Once inputs are downloaded, they are cached locally (`util.cache_input_data`)
  - If you suspect your input is corrupted, you can manually request a fresh copy by deleting cached copy on disk and restarting script
- The `User-Agent` header in `aoc_gateway.fetch_input` is set to me since I maintain this tool! 🙋‍♂️
